# AstroNivesh AI – Astrology-Driven Market Intelligence Engine

**AstroNivesh AI** is a rule-based, Panchang-driven, sector-aware market intelligence system that blends **Vedic astrology** with structured market interpretation. It is designed for traders, investors, and researchers who believe that **timing cycles influence market behavior**.

Unlike generic astrology tools, AstroNivesh AI focuses on **intraday timing, sector rotation, and daily market mood**, using a structured scoring engine built on classical astrological principles.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

Markets move in cycles.  
Astrology studies cycles.  

AstroNivesh AI bridges the two with one key question:

> **“Given today’s cosmic conditions, what kind of market day is likely, and which sectors are favoured?”**

---

## 🔮 Key Components

### 1️⃣ Panchang-Based Timing
The system evaluates:
- Tithi  
- Nakshatra  
- Yoga  
- Karana  
- Moon’s Nakshatra–Pada position  

These determine **intraday mood & volatility windows**.

---

### 2️⃣ Fast-Planet Influence
Analysis includes:
- Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars  
- Exaltation / Debilitation  
- Combustion  
- Retrograde  
- Transit strength  
- Inter-planetary relationships  

These heavily influence **sector rotation & market sentiment**.

---

### 3️⃣ Sector–Planet Mapping
Custom associations enable sharper predictions:

| Planet   | Associated Sectors |
|----------|--------------------|
| Mercury  | IT, Telecom, Finance |
| Venus    | FMCG, Pharma, Luxury |
| Mars     | Energy, Defense, Metals |
| Jupiter  | Banking, Education, Stability sectors |
| Saturn   | PSU, Infrastructure, Heavy Industries |

---

### 4️⃣ Vedh & Sparsh Rules
AstroNivesh AI scores planetary:
- **Obstructions (Vedh)**  
- **Energetic Touches (Sparsh)**  

These modify sentiment scores dynamically.

---

### 5️⃣ Scoring System (High-Level)
Each astro factor contributes to:
- **Market Mood Score**  
- **Sector Strength Score**  
- **Intraday Volatility Score**  

Outputs are clean & trader-friendly:
- Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / Volatile  
- Sector Bias → Strong / Weak / Mixed  
- Time Windows → Momentum / Reversal / Caution  

---

## 📊 Example Output

A typical AstroNivesh AI interpretation looks like:

- **Market Mood:** Mildly bullish till noon; cautious post-1 PM  
- **Bullish Sectors:** IT, Pharma, FMCG  
- **Weak Sectors:** Metals, PSU Banks  
- **Intraday Window:** 9:20–10:10 AM high volatility due to Moon–Ketu influence  
- **Overall Bias:** Buy dips in strong sectors; avoid chasing breakouts  

No vague storytelling — **clear, actionable guidance**.

## 🌟 Why AstroNivesh AI Is Different

### ✔ Rule-Based, Not Guru-Based  
Everything uses documented rules, look-up tables, and weights.

### ✔ Intraday-Focused Astrology  
Uses Nakshatra–Pada timing, rarely applied in financial astrology.

### ✔ Sector-Level Insights  
Goes beyond index-level predictions.

### ✔ AI-Compatible Design  
Outputs structured so ChatGPT, Replit AI, Claude, Perplexity, etc. can interpret easily.
